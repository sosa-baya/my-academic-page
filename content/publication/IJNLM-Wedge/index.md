abstract: '<div style="text-align: justify">Eigenstrains are created as a result
  of anelastic effects such as defects, temperature changes, bulk growth, etc.,
  and strongly affect the overall response of solids. In this paper, we study
  the residual stress and deformation fields of an incompressible, isotropic,
  infinite wedge due to a circumferentially symmetric distribution of finite
  eigenstrains. In particular, we establish explicit exact solutions for the
  residual stresses and deformation of a neo-Hookean wedge containing a
  symmetric inclusion with finite radial and circumferential eigenstrains. In
  addition, we numerically solve for the residual stress field of a neo-Hookean
  wedge induced by a symmetric Mooneyâ€“Rivlin inhomogeneity with finite
  eigenstrains.</div>'
