<big><big><b>Abstract</b></big></big>
<div style="text-align: justify">In this PhD thesis, we propose a theoretical framework for studying
  referential and spatial evolutions in nonlinear elasticity. We use the
  referential evolution-- considering an evolving reference configuration-- to
  formulate a geometric theory of anelasticity. Indeed, an anelasticity source
  (such as temperature, defects, or growth) can manifest itself such that the
  body would fail to find a relaxed state in the Euclidean physical space.
  However, a reference configuration should by essence be stress-free so that
  one can properly quantify the strain with respect to it-- and the stress by
  means of a constitutive equation. Identifying the reference configuration with
  an abstract manifold-- material manifold-- allows for a rational construction
  of such a stress-free state which can further accommodate the evolution of the
  source of anelasticity by allowing the material manifold to have an evolving
  geometry. In this work, we formulate a general geometric theory of
  anelasticity for three-dimensional bodies that we apply to the particular case
  of thermoelasticity; and we also formulate a general theory of anelastic
  shells that we apply to the particular case of morphoelastic shells, i.e.,
  those subject to growth and remodeling. In the context of anelasticity, as
  well as in nonlinear elasticity, most exact solutions are obtained by assuming
  some restrictive class of symmetry for the solution. We propose a theory of
  small-on-large anelasticity, that is analogous to the small-on-large theory of
  Green et al. in classical elasticity. It can be used to find exact solutions
  for non-symmetric distributions of anelasticity sources that are small
  perturbations of symmetric ones. Finally, motivated by gaining further
  insights on the theory of nonlinear elasticity as well as the case of a
  continuum deforming in an evolving ambient space, we formulate a theory of
  nonlinear elasticity where the geometry of the ambient space is
  time-dependent.</div>
