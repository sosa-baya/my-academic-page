<big><big><b>Abstract</b></big></big>
<div style="text-align: justify">In this paper we formulate a
  geometric theory of nonlinear thermoelasticity that can be used to calculate
  the time evolution of temperature and thermal stress fields in a nonlinear
  elastic body. In particular, this formulation can be used to calculate
  residual thermal stresses. In this theory the material manifold (natural
  stress-free configuration of the body) is a Riemannian manifold with a
  temperature-dependent metric. Evolution of the geometry of the material
  manifold is governed by a generalized heat equation. As examples, we consider
  an infinitely long circular cylindrical bar with a cylindrically symmetric
  temperature distribution and a spherical ball with a spherically-symmetric
  temperature distribution. In both cases we assume that the body is made of an
  arbitrary incompressible isotropic solid. We numerically solve for the
  evolution of thermal stress fields induced by thermal inclusions in both a
  cylindrical bar and a spherical ball, and compare the linear and nonlinear
  solutions for a generalized neo-Hookean material.</div>
