<big><big><b>Abstract</b></big></big>
<div style="text-align: justify">In this paper, we formulate a
  nonlinear elasticity theory in which the ambient space is evolving. For a
  continuum moving in an evolving ambient space, we model time dependency of the
  metric by a time-dependent embedding of the ambient space in a larger manifold
  with a fixed background metric. We derive both the tangential and the normal
  governing equations. We then reduce the standard energy balance written in the
  larger ambient space to that in the evolving ambient space. We consider
  quasi-static deformations of the ambient space and show that a quasi-static
  deformation of the ambient space results in stresses, in general. We linearize
  the nonlinear theory about a reference motion and show that variation of the
  spatial metric corresponds to an effective field of body forces.</div>
