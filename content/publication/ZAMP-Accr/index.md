abstract: In this paper, we formulate a theory for the coupling of accretion
  mechanics and thermoelasticity. We present an analytical formulation of the
  thermoelastic accretion of an infinite cylinder and of a two-dimensional
  block. We develop numerical schemes for the solution of these two problems,
  and numerically calculate residual stresses and observe a strong dependence of
  the final mechanical state on the parameters of the accretion process. This
  suggests the possibility to predict and control thermal accretion processes of
  soft materials by manipulating thermal parameters, and therefore, to realize
  additively manufactured soft objects with the desired characteristics and
  performances.
