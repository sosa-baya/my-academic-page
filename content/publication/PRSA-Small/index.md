abstract: In this paper, we are concerned with finding exact solutions for the
  stress fields of nonlinear solids with non-symmetric distributions of defects
  (or more generally finite eigenstrains) that are small perturbations of
  symmetric distributions of defects with known exact solutions. In the language
  of geometric mechanics, this corresponds to finding a deformation that is a
  result of a perturbation of the metric of the Riemannian material manifold. We
  present a general framework that can be used for a systematic analysis of this
  class of anelasticity problems. This geometric formulation can be thought of
  as a material analogue of the classical small-on-large theory in nonlinear
  elasticity. We use the present small-on-large anelasticity theory to find
  exact solutions for the stress fields of some non-symmetric distributions of
  screw dislocations in incompressible isotropic solids.
