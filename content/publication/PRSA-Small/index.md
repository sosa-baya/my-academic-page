abstract: '![Alt Text](fig.png)
<div style="text-align: justify">In this paper, we are concerned with
  finding exact solutions for the stress fields of nonlinear solids with
  non-symmetric distributions of defects (or more generally finite eigenstrains)
  that are small perturbations of symmetric distributions of defects with known
  exact solutions. In the language of geometric mechanics, this corresponds to
  finding a deformation that is a result of a perturbation of the metric of the
  Riemannian material manifold. We present a general framework that can be used
  for a systematic analysis of this class of anelasticity problems. This
  geometric formulation can be thought of as a material analogue of the
  classical small-on-large theory in nonlinear elasticity. We use the present
  small-on-large anelasticity theory to find exact solutions for the stress
  fields of some non-symmetric distributions of screw dislocations in
  incompressible isotropic solids.</div>'
