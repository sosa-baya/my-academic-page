<big><big><b>Abstract</b></big></big>
<div style="text-align: justify">The objective of this short note is
  to trace back the major contributions that led to the multiplicative
  decomposition of the deformation gradient in finite plasticity, nonlinear
  thermoelasticity, and growth mechanics.</div>
