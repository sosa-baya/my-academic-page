abstract: "Over the past decade, kirigami—the Japanese art of paper cutting—has
  been playing an increasing role in the emerging field of mechanical
  metamatertials and a myriad of other mechanical applications. Nonetheless, a
  deep understanding of the mathematics and mechanics of kirigami structures is
  yet to be achieved in order to unlock their full potential to pioneer more
  advanced applications in the field. In this work, we study the most
  fundamental geometric building block of kirigami: a thin sheet with a single
  cut. We consider a reduced two-dimensional plate model of a circular thin disk
  with a radial slit and investigate its deformation following the opening of
  the slit and the rotation of its lips. In the isometric limit—as the thickness
  of the disk approaches zero—the elastic energy has no stretching contribution
  and the thin sheet takes a conical shape known as the e-cone. We solve the
  post-buckling problem for the e-cone in the geometrically nonlinear setting
  assuming a Saint Venant-Kirchhoff constitutive plate model; we find
  closed-form expressions for the stress fields and show the geometry of the
  e-cone to be governed by the spherical elastica problem. This allows us to
  fully map out the space of solutions and investigate the stability of the
  post-buckled e-cone problem assuming mirror symmetric boundary conditions on
  the rotation of the lips on the open slit."
