<div style="text-align: justify">Originally from Beni-Mellal, Morocco, I was educated in Morocco, France, and the United States. I am currently based in Aarhus, Denmark, where I am a postdoctoral researcher in the Mechanical Metamaterials and Soft Matter group within the Department of Mechanical and Production Engineering at Aarhus University. My background and research interests lie at the crossroads of engineering, mechanics, and applied mathematics with a view on industrial applications such as in mechanical, structural, and materials engineering; and on exploring the mechanics of naturally occurring phenomena, such as biological growth and morphogenesis.</div></br>
