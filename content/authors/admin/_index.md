I am a mechanician based in Aarhus, Denmark. I am currently working as a postdoctoral researcher in the Mechanical Metamaterials and Soft Matter group within the Department of Mechanical and Production Engineering at Aarhus University**.** My research interests lie within the general areas of solid and engineering mechanics with a view on industrial applications such as in mechanical, structural, manufacturing, robotics, biomechanics, and materials engineering; and on exploring naturally occurring phenomena, such as biological growth and morphogenesis.
