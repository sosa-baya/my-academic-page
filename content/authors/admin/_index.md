I am a mechanician based in Aarhus, Denmark. I am currently working as a postdoctoral researcher in the Mechanical Metamaterials and Soft Matter group within the Department of Mechanical and Production Engineering at Aarhus University. My research interests lie within the general areas of solid and engineering mechanics with a view on industrial applications such as in mechanical, structural, manufacturing, robotics, biomechanics, and materials engineering; and on exploring naturally occurring phenomena, such as biological growth and morphogenesis.
